# K-Nearest Neighbour(KNN)
The k-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm is a simple, easy-to-implement supervised machine learning algorithm that can be used to solve both classification and regression problems.
The KNN algorithm assumes that similar things exist in close proximity. In other words, similar things are near to each other.
The KNN algorithm hinges on this assumption being true enough for the algorithm to be useful. KNN captures the idea of similarity 
(sometimes called distance, proximity, or closeness) with some mathematics we might have learned in our childhood— calculating the distance between points on a graph.

Here are some jupyter notebook files that can give you a clear understanding on how to start with the KNN algorithm and perform it in various Regression/Classification datasets.
